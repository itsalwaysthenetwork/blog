Although I&amp;rsquo;ve heard their name in passing previously, I&amp;rsquo;ve never actually checked them out. After seeing their presentation, I can say I wish I had looked at them before, because there&amp;rsquo;s tremendous value here.
First Impressions Forward Networks does a few things, but at a (very) basic level, it combines some of the functionality of Batfish and SuzieQ, then wraps a pretty enterprise UI on top.</description></item><item><title>NFD27 - Network to Code</title><link>https://blog.itsalwaysthe.network/posts/nfd-27-network-to-code/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.itsalwaysthe.network/posts/nfd-27-network-to-code/</guid><description>Preamble time! Nautobot vs. NetBox has been a sensitive subject in the community. I&amp;rsquo;m not here to sway you or endorse one over the other. Use what you think fits you and your organization best.
After ZPE, Network to Code was up to talk to us about all of the latest with Nautobot. The presentations were cohesive, and they told a compelling story: you&amp;rsquo;ve got stuff to do, and we help you do those things.</description></item><item><title>NFD27 - ZPE</title><link>https://blog.itsalwaysthe.network/posts/nfd-27-zpe/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.itsalwaysthe.network/posts/nfd-27-zpe/</guid><description>The first company presenting at NFD27 was ZPE. They talked about their Gen 3 Out-of-Band Management systems and the Zero Pain Ecosystem.
In an interesting revelation, ZPE stands for Zero Point Energy, not Zero Pain Ecosystem. Clever bit of marketing.
OOBM is old news. It&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;table stakes&amp;rdquo;. So what makes ZPE&amp;rsquo;s OOBM something to look at?
First Impressions Honestly, the presentation started out a bit of a mess. We circled the journey three or four times, regularly rehashing the same information.</description></item></channel></rss>
