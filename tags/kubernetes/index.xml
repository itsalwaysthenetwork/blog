It features a basic service with the following endpoints:
/healhtz: a healthcheck endpoint that always responds with a 200 status code /: the base endpoint, which generates a random number a random number of times Later, we&amp;rsquo;ll discover that the random number generation function in our original service is suffering from horrible performance.</description></item><item><title>Managing Virtual Network Labs with KNE</title><link>https://blog.itsalwaysthe.network/posts/kubernetes-based-network-emulation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://blog.itsalwaysthe.network/posts/kubernetes-based-network-emulation/</guid><description>This post will be a (very short) introduction to kne, a project from Google that lets you run virtual network topologies in Kubernetes.
